# Job Posting for a TLA+ Infrastructure Engineer

## Motivation (note: not part of the actual post)

This is a job posting for a hypothetical TLA+ Foundation first hire.
This person's responsibilities would primarily involve "infrastructure" work, rather than feature work or bugfixes for the tools.
In particular, this person would be responsible for coordinating versioned releases of the TLA+ tools (possibly expanding to TLAPS and the VS Code extension).
What sort of work is required of this position? Here are some examples I can think of:
 * Expanding & improving automated testing (UI, performance, regression, integration, functional, unit tests)
 * Maintaining a benchmark database of time/memory performance for the tools over time
 * Writing detailed release notes describing changes
 * Writing CI/CD scripts to automate as much of the testing & release process as possible
 * Improving build times and reducing size of build outputs
 * Maintaining, improving, and documenting developer experience (setup, local build, local testing on various platforms)

Note that while these responsibilities are not "complicated" in any theoretical or algorithmic sense, given the low amount of overhead available for mentorship it is desirable to hire a candidate with some work experience as they will need to be fairly self-directed.

One interesting question is whether we should require a Bachelor's in Computer Science or Software Engineering for this position.
It is not my impression that bootcamps or alternative forms of education focus much on infrastructure tasks of this sort, but I could be wrong.
It's not like CS degrees focus on this much either, although I'm a decade out of college so maybe they actually do teach how to set up a CI/CD pipeline these days.
